# XML File Parser

This is an educational project created for a Computer Science course at CSUF. 
The purpose of this program is to read an XML file, parse its contents, and provide search functionality via the console. 
The project is designed to be cross-platform, supporting both Windows and Linux.

## Features

- Cross-platform support (Windows and Linux)
- XML file parsing
- Console-based search functionality

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (supporting C++11 or later)
- Python (for the wrapper)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/carl098173/xmlparserCmake
    ```
2. Create a build directory and navigate into it:

   cd xml-file-parser
   mkdir build
   cd build

3. Generate the build files using CMake:
   cmake ..

4. Build the project:
   make

## Usage

1. Ensure the XML file you want to parse is placed in the same directory as the executable.

2. Run the program:

    ```bash
    ./xmlparserCmake
    ```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to search and display parameters from the XML file.

**The associated XML file is included within the project.
